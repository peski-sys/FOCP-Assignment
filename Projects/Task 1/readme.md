# Beckett Pizza Plaza – 4-for-3 Offer


## Overview
This program calculates the total cost of a pizza order at **Beckett Pizza Plaza** using their *Four-for-Three* offer. Customers must order **exactly four pizzas**, and the **cheapest pizza is free**.


The program:
- Accepts four pizza prices from the user
- Validates input (numeric and greater than zero)
- Calculates the final order total
- Displays the discount achieved as a percentage


## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the price of each pizza.
2. Invalid inputs (non-numeric or zero/negative values) are rejected.
3. The cheapest pizza is deducted from the total.
4. The final price and discount percentage are displayed.

## Notes
- The discount will never exceed 25%.
- Prices are displayed to two decimal places.
- The program is written for beginner-level Python and focuses on clarity and correctness.
