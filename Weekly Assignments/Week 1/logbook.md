Study Logbook

Day 1:
Read about programming languages and how Python fits in. Python is a high-level, interpreted language supporting multiple paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional). It’s widely used because of its simplicity and versatility.

# Example: Basic print statement
print("Hello, World!")

Day 2:
Studied the different language generations. Machine code is hard to write and read, assembly uses mnemonics, and high-level languages like Python are easier. Python code is portable and often interpreted or compiled just-in-time.

# Example: Simple calculation in Python
result = (45 + 20) * 2
print(result)  # Output: 130

Day 3:
Tried using the Python interpreter (REPL). Learned about command features like auto-completion and help system. Experimented with evaluating expressions interactively.

# Example: Using the interpreter
>>> 5 ** 3
125
>>> help(print)
# Displays help info on print function

Day 4:
Practiced writing expressions and understood operators: +, -, *, /, ** (exponentiation), // (floor division), % (modulus). Recognized that expressions are building blocks of programs.

# More complex expression
a = 10
b = 3
print(a ** b)  # Output: 1000
print(a // b)  # Output: 3
print(a % b)   # Output: 1

Day 5:
Learned about common errors—syntax errors (wrong syntax) and logical errors (incorrect algorithm). Practice reading error tracebacks carefully to debug, e.g., missing colon or indentation errors.

# Example of a syntax error
if a > b
print("A is greater")  # Missing colon causes syntax error

# Correct:
if a > b:
print("A is greater")
