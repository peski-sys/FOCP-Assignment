# Study Logbook – Control Statements (Python)

## Topic
Control Statements – if, loops, boolean logic

---

## Key Ideas
- Programs use **logic**, not just line-by-line code
- Logic is built using:
  - **Sequence** (normal flow)
  - **Selection** (decisions)
  - **Iteration** (loops)

---

## Boolean Expressions
- Always return `True` or `False`
- Used in `if`, `while`, loops

Example:
```python
x = 10
x > 5   # True
